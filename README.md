## Overview
R-LIME is a new method that explain behavior of black-box classifiers such as deep neural networks or ensemble models.
It linearly approximizes a decision boundary of the black-box classifier in a rectangular region, and maximizes the region as long as the approximation accuracy is higher than a given threshold.
Then, it provides contribution of each feature to prediction and rule that restricted the approximation region.
